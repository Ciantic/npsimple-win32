==============
npsimple-win32
==============

This is fork of original *npsimple* which I have added and removed stuff to get it working with *Visual Studio 2008*.

Dependencies
============
- xulrunner-sdk (the npapi stuff) https://developer.mozilla.org/en/gecko_sdk#Downloading

After downloading set up *environment variable* called ``GECKOSDKDIR``, like::

	GECKOSDKDIR = ...\xulrunner-sdk\include
